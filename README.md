OK, here is the story.

The name of our server is bluedcraft currently. We didn't realize there is something wrong with this name until I googled "what is blued" after I uploaded the code to this repository yesterday. 

"Blued" is a gay dating website(or app maybe?) but our server have nothing to do with gay dating, so I asked if we can change the server name to something else.

The Chinese name of our server is 梦の世界 (hell knows why there's a Japanese charactor in it). So the owner of the server, Chad(he is not from Africa) suggested that we should probably use "bluedreamcraft" instedad.

"Blue Dream, also known as Blueberry Haze, is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain of Cannabis. Blue Dream is a cross between the Blueberry and Haze strains, and was created around 2003 in Santa Cruz, California." --via wikipedia

FamilyTong, also called bluedcaftCloud, is a personal account management tool for players of this minecraft server.
