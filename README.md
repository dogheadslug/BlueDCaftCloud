OK, here is the story.

The name of our server is "bluedcraft". We didn't realize there is something wrong with this name until I googled "blued" after I uploaded the code to this repository yesterday. 

"Blued" is a gay dating website(or app maybe?) but our server have nothing to do with gay dating stuff, so I asked if we can change the server name to something else.

The Chinese name of our server is 梦の世界 (hell knows why there's a Japanese charactor in it) which means dream's world. So the owner of the server, Chad(he's the source of this misleading name and he's not from Africa) suggested that we should probably use "bluedreamcraft" instead.

So I did some research again.

"Blue Dream, also known as Blueberry Haze, is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain of Cannabis. Blue Dream is a cross between the Blueberry and Haze strains, and was created around 2003 in Santa Cruz, California." --via wikipedia

End of story.
